## Running Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
# Start local server (in one terminal)
npm run serve

# Run all browser tests (in another terminal)
npm run test:browser
```

### Individual Test Suites
```bash
npm run test:repository  # Repository operations
npm run test:files      # File management
npm run test:vcs        # Version control
npm run test:ui         # UI interactions
```

### Debug and Development
```bash
npm run test:browser:debug    # Interactive debugging
npm run test:browser:headed   # Watch tests run
npm run test:browser:ui       # Visual test runner
npm run test:browser:report   # View test results
```

## Next Steps - Implementation Phase

With comprehensive tests in place, the implementation can proceed with confidence:

### Phase 1: Browser Storage Adapter
- Create `lib/browser/browser-storage.js`
- Implement SQL.js integration
- Ensure test compatibility

### Phase 2: Core Browser Bundle  
- Create `webdvcs-browser-core.js`
- Remove Node.js dependencies
- Validate against existing tests

### Phase 3: UI Polish
- Complete interface improvements
- Validate UI interaction tests

### Phase 4: File Management UI
- Create file upload/download system
- Implement drag-and-drop
- Validate file operation tests

### Phase 5: Complete Web Interface
- Build responsive HTML interface  
- Implement all UI interactions
- Pass all visual and UX tests

## Test-First Development Benefits

✅ **Clear Requirements**: Tests define exact expected behavior  
✅ **Regression Prevention**: Immediate feedback when features break  
✅ **Documentation**: Tests serve as living specification  
✅ **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive coverage from day one  
✅ **Confidence**: Implementation guided by failing tests  
✅ **Maintenance**: Easy to refactor with test safety net

## Current Status: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

The test suite provides a comprehensive foundation for building the WebDVCS browser interface. All major functionality is defined through tests, ensuring that the implementation will meet user expectations and maintain high quality standards.

**Total Test Investment**: ~150 test cases covering every aspect of the planned browser interface, from basic file operations to advanced VCS features and comprehensive UI interactions.

**Implementation can now proceed with confidence** - each feature can be built to pass the existing tests, ensuring quality and completeness.
